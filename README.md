The Y-Axis, or Elasped Time(s) is how long it took for the code to finish equating each number from the fibanachi sequence. The X-Axis is a representation of each iteration of the fibanichi sequence being performed by the code, on the axis it counts up by multiples of 20 but each dot on the graph is a representation of each of the 100 times the sequence is performed.
